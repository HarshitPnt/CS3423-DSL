# CS3423-DSL
YAFSM is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to work with Finite State Machines (FSMs), specifically focusing on Deterministic Finite Automata(DFAs),Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) and Pushdown Automata (PDA). 

With YAFSM, you can easily define, specify, and manipulate the behavior of these automata in a clear and concise manner.
