# Introduction

## What is XYZ?

## Why XYZ?

# Language Specifications

XYZ follows, making it easier for programmers to pick up the language easily and keep their focus on the logic rather than the language.

- XYZ is a **statically typed** language
- XYZ is a **strongly typed** language
- XYZ is a **procedural** language

XYZ does not support Object Oriented Programming(**OOPs**).

## Data Types

The language uses common data types found in most programming languages.

### Primitive Data Types

#### Integer
Integers are represented by the `int_x` keyword, where `x` is the number of bits used to represent the integer. The language supports 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit integers.

#### Character
Characters are represented by the `char` keyword. The language supports 8 bit characters.

#### Float
Floats are represented by the `float_x` keyword, where `x` is the number of bits used to represent the float. The language supports 32 and 64 bit floats.

#### Boolean
Booleans are represented by the `bool` keyword, which is similar to the `bool` keyword in C, C++, Java and Python.
